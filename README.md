# Netflix Recommendation System
### Overview
The Netflix Recommendation System project aims to develop a personalized recommendation engine that suggests movies and TV shows to users based on content similarities. The system uses content-based filtering techniques to analyze metadata such as genre, director, and cast to provide tailored recommendations. The goal is to enhance user satisfaction and engagement by offering relevant content suggestions that align closely with individual preferences.

### Problem Statement
In an era of overwhelming content choices, Netflix users often struggle to find shows and movies that match their preferences, leading to user dissatisfaction and potential churn. This project addresses this issue by developing a recommendation system that leverages content-based filtering to suggest titles based on metadata similarities, thereby improving the personalized viewing experience and increasing user retention on the platform.
